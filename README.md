# scenario-planning-tool

My Work : 
I have created a "SCENARIO PLANNING TOOL" for a company name "AtliQ Hardware" for its customer "Croma" & Product is "Mouse & Keyboard". It will definitely gonna help them in analyzing which discount would be given by seeing the trends of all the three cases.

data\
company_name : AtliQ Hardware\
product_name : Keyboard & Mouse\
Discount : 10%\
COGS : 30%\
AVG NIP $6\
GM Target : $100000\
Sale unit target for Best Case : 1,00,000 ---------generates gross margin of $278,000\
Sale unit target for Realistic Case : 50,000 ---------generates gross margin of $89,000\
Sale unit target for Worst Case : 25,000 ---------generates gross margin loss of $5,500\
\
conclusion : on providing the discount of 10% it is producing the gross margin greater than the gross margin target in the case of best & realistic
             but in the case of worst it genearting a gross margin lesser than the target gross margin.
